# Math Tools

A collection of mathematical algorithms implemented in C.  
The goal is to write modular and reusable implementations of common techniques used in mathematics and computing. Developed to meet my own needs.

## Current Algorithms
- **Gaussian Elimination for Real Numbers**  
  Solve systems of linear equations using floating-point arithmetic.
- **Gaussian Elimination over GF(2)**  
  Solve systems over the finite field of two elements, useful in cryptography.

## Licence
These implementations were created by me, [Nithik R](https://github.com/noinoiexists) and is protected under the MIT Licence. You can read more about it in the [LICENCE](https://github.com/noinoiexists/Math-Tools/blob/main/LICENSE) file.
